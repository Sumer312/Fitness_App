<b style="font-size:1.5em;"><i>Description</i></b>\
This is a personal project, it is a full fledged fitness tracker. There are 3 programs a user can select, fat loss, muscle gain and maintenance. Your calorie
deficit or surplus will be calculated based on the program you've selected and your weight, height, current weight and desired weight. It comes with a 
calorie calculator where you can enter the prompt in human readable text like "200 ml of whole milk" and it will output the nutrition of the input prompt.
You can even track your progress.

<b style="font-size:1.5em;"><i>Motivation</i></b>\
Motivation for making this project was that I wanted an application to suggest the amount of calories something had and I wanted it to show me my deficit
if I am cutting or my surplus if I am bulking. I also was learning Go and HTMX and saw this as a great idea for a personal project.
